# What it is about

It's a POC that focus on doing a simple counter and a rest api call that fetch an image using some frameworks to write less code.

### Android Annotations 

It's a very large library that has annotations for almost everything you need. With Android Annotations you can inject views, services, menus, beans, make API calls (that unfortunatelly didn't work for me) etc. 

### Retrofit

Library for simplify the process o building API calls.

### Universal Image Loader

Library for loading images from lots of sources with ease.

### Sugar ORM

Very simple library capable of mapping your entities with a few annotations and has minimal configuration to do.





More libraries may be added to this POC...
